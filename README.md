# ODButtun
#### This is just a simple batch file that acts as a shutdown button on the desktop windows.
#### It's just the off button on the desktop, I didn't do it seriously and just for indulge!
## Using
#### **Just move the ODButton folder to Program Files and put the shortcut on your desktop.**
